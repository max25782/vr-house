# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 360-degree panorama viewer currently crashes when users click the VR activation button. The crash occurs due to complex event handling, race conditions, and multiple overlapping VR activation attempts in both the cube panorama viewer and regular panorama viewer components. This feature aims to stabilize the VR functionality and provide a reliable, crash-free experience for users wanting to enter VR mode.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing a 360-degree panorama, I want to click the VR button without the application crashing, so that I can reliably enter VR mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the VR button THEN the system SHALL activate VR mode without causing application crashes
2. WHEN VR activation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message without crashing
3. WHEN multiple VR activation attempts occur THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate processing and race conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user on iOS, I want the gyroscope permission request to work smoothly, so that I can use VR mode with device orientation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an iOS user clicks VR THEN the system SHALL request gyroscope permissions only once per session
2. WHEN gyroscope permission is granted THEN the system SHALL activate VR mode immediately
3. WHEN gyroscope permission is denied THEN the system SHALL show a helpful message without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent VR behavior across both cube panorama and regular panorama viewers, so that the experience is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using either panorama viewer type THEN the system SHALL provide identical VR activation behavior
2. WHEN VR mode is active THEN the system SHALL handle fullscreen and gyroscope consistently
3. WHEN exiting VR mode THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and event listeners

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and logging for VR functionality, so that I can debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VR errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN VR activation times out THEN the system SHALL provide specific timeout error messages
3. WHEN plugin initialization fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the VR button to be responsive and provide visual feedback, so that I know my interaction was registered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the VR button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN VR is activating THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the button
3. WHEN VR activation completes THEN the system SHALL update the button state appropriately
